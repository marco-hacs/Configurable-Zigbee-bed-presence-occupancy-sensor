# Configurable-Zigbee-bed-presence-occupancy-sensor
The bed sensor is mainly a 3d printed structure with a switch that closes the zigbee circuit.

Hi all, I am thrilled to present a project that me and my friend Lucawere recently involved.

First why we started the project…
We was in search for a reliable zigbee **battery** powered bed sensor to put **under the mattress**, found some interesting idea but none seem reliable or do not have the charateristic we want form the sensor for example some sensor need to be under the blankets but our idea was a set and forget sensor under the mattress.
So after some thinkering and a lot of test we came up to this idea:

The bom and build istruction can be found here:
<i>[Costruire un Sensore Bed Presence Zigbee - DomHouse.it](https://domhouse.it/costruire-un-sensore-bed-presence-zigbee/)</i>

It’s an nice italian website about home automation with a lot of resource where we first get the sensor published .

The bed sensor is mainly a 3d printed structure with a switch that close the zigbee circuit. *You have to put it under the mattress and set the right elevation of the switch with the knob*. After a week the 3d printed structure probably will deform slightly and you have to re-set again the elevation and after that it will remain stable.

This sensor is begin tested by me and my friend from three weeks and it’s working relly really well with an aquara water leak sensor.
Hope all of you can enjoy our sensor and if some don’t have a 3d printer we can print it for you for a small fee.
